Project Title: Echoes of Tradition - Indo-Global Heritage Website
Role: Expert Frontend Developer & UI Designer

Goal: Create a visually stunning, detail-rich website focused on Heritage and Culture. The content scope is global but with a heavy priority on Indian traditions. The site relies on high-quality visuals paired with deep, informative captions.

Tech Stack:
- HTML5 (Semantic structure)
- CSS3 (TailwindCSS via CDN)
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS for interactivity)
- Google Fonts: 'Cinzel' (for majestic/historical headings) and 'Lato' (for readable detailed captions).
- FontAwesome (for UI icons)

Design Aesthetic:
- Theme: "Saffron & Stone."
- Color Palette:
  - Primary: Deep Terracotta/Saffron (#E35639)
  - Secondary: Muted Emerald Green (#2E5D4B)
  - Background: Off-White/Parchment (#F9F7F2)
  - Text: Dark Slate (#2D3748)
  - Accents: Antique Gold (#C5A059)
- Vibe: Editorial, Museum-quality, Clean, Respectful.

Core Sections:

1. Hero Section:
   - Full-screen background image (Use a placeholder of an Indian monument like Hampi or Taj Mahal).
   - Headline: "Echoes of Tradition" in large, 'Cinzel' font.
   - Subheadline: "Bridging the timeless heritage of India with the world."
   - Action: A "Explore the Journey" button that smooth-scrolls to the next section.

2. Introduction (The Context):
   - A clean layout explaining the project.
   - Text Focus: "India’s culture is a tapestry woven into the global narrative."
   - Style: Large serif font, centered, with ornamental dividers (mandala or geometric patterns).

3. Cultural Pillars (The Core - Visuals + Captions):
   - Layout: A 3-column "Card" grid.
   - Content Examples: "Indian Architecture," "Philosophy (Yoga/Vedas)," "Global Influences."
   - Interaction: The cards should be image-heavy.
   - **CRITICAL FEATURE (Hover Reveal):** On hover, the image should darken slightly, and a detailed caption (50-70 words) should slide up from the bottom. This meets the "detailed caption" requirement without cluttering the UI.

4. The Visual Timeline:
   - A vertical timeline focusing on key eras (e.g., Indus Valley, Vedic Age, Silk Road trade).
   - Design: Alternating Left/Right layout.
   - Visuals: Each timeline node has a circular image.
   - Text: Next to the image, provide a "Snapshot" title and a detailed descriptive paragraph.

5. "Windows to the Past" (Gallery):
   - Layout: Masonry Grid (pinterest style).
   - Content: Mix of Indian festivals, art forms (Kathakali, Madhubani), and global landmarks.
   - Interaction: Clicking an image opens a Modal (Lightbox).
   - Modal Content: The modal must split 50/50—Image on the left, **Detailed Explanation** on the right. This allows for the "detail-rich" text the user needs.

6. Footer:
   - Simple, elegant. "Designed by [Your Name]." Links to GitHub.

Functionality Requirements:
- Responsive Design: Must stack perfectly on mobile.
- Animations: Use `AOS` (Animate On Scroll) library logic via CSS (fade-in-up) for elements as they enter the viewport.
- Images: Use high-quality Unsplash source URLs with specific keywords (e.g., `source.unsplash.com/random/?india,temple`, `source.unsplash.com/random/?culture`).

Deliverables:
- index.html
- style.css (containing custom Tailwind config or overrides)
- script.js (handling the Modal and Scroll animations)
